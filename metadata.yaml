description: '"Bread Overhead" is a story Fritz Leiber could have written to send
  up today''s bewildering bread aisle -- all those claims of low-cal and low-low-carb.
  In fact, the story probably reads better now than it did in 1958, back when the
  choice came down to white or whole wheat. Leiber slyly imagines a near-future when
  giant machines not only harvest the wheat field, but grind flour and bake bread
  on the spot -- the ultimate in big farming. In this toasted tomorrow, the highly-mechanized
  Puffy Products is bent on producing the supremely lightest loaf. The story is what
  happens if bread isn''t just airy, but pumped full of lighter-than-air helium. Leiber
  (Ships to the Stars) didn''t often bake up such a souffle of spoof, but he''s a
  master in the kitchen. And "Bread Overhead" has just enough to say about human nature
  to be filling, besides.'
